/*
 * This plugin carries its own copy of the template-tag scanner, because importing the client's
 * copy into the plugin bundle fails to build on Windows in CI.
 *
 * Rather than copying the expectations too — copied expectations can't detect drift — this
 * imports the client's `resolvedModelName.cases.ts` and runs the plugin's copy against it, then
 * asserts the plugin's output matches the client's own `resolvedModelName` for every case. A
 * change to the client scanner or its cases therefore fails here until the copy is updated. The
 * import is test-only and never reaches the plugin bundle, so the Windows problem doesn't apply.
